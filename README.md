# Ballerina By Example Repository
Welcome to the Ballerina By Example repository! This repository contains the code examples from the official Ballerina By Example documentation.

## 📘 About
Ballerina is this cool new programming language, optimized for integration  and cloud-native applications (Disclaimer — might be a bit biased here ;)). Ballerina comes with built-in support to address a wide range of integration needs. Do check out the official resources for more information on the available features and to set up and try out Ballerina!

The examples in this repository cover various features and capabilities of Ballerina, ranging from basic syntax to advanced features like transactions, query expressions, and concurrency.

Each example is organized into its own directory with:
- The example code (main.bal or similar files).
- Explanations or references to the corresponding section of the documentation.
